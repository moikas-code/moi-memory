# Resilience Features Implementation

## Overview
The Knowledge Graph MCP Server includes comprehensive resilience features to handle various failure scenarios and ensure high availability in production environments.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `src/circuit_breaker.rs`

The circuit breaker protects the Neo4j database from cascading failures by monitoring operation success/failure rates and temporarily failing fast when the database is unhealthy.

**Key Features**:
- Three states: Closed (normal), Open (failing fast), HalfOpen (testing recovery)
- Configurable failure/success thresholds
- Automatic state transitions based on operation outcomes
- Detailed metrics and statistics tracking

**Configuration**:
```rust
CircuitBreakerConfig {
    failure_threshold: 5,     // Open after 5 consecutive failures
    success_threshold: 3,     // Close after 3 consecutive successes in HalfOpen
    timeout: Duration::from_secs(30),  // Stay open for 30s before testing
    window: Duration::from_secs(60),   // Reset counters every 60s
}
```

**Integration**: All Neo4j operations in `knowledge_graph.rs` are wrapped with `circuit_breaker.call_async()`.

### 2. Connection Pool with Auto-Reconnection ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `src/connection_pool.rs`

Intelligent connection pool that maintains multiple Neo4j connections and automatically recovers from connection failures.

**Key Features**:
- Configurable min/max connection limits
- Automatic connection health monitoring
- Background reconnection attempts with exponential backoff
- Failed connection detection and removal
- Comprehensive connection statistics and metrics

**Configuration**:
```rust
PoolConfig {
    max_connections: 10,
    min_connections: 2,
    connection_timeout: Duration::from_secs(30),
    health_check_interval: Duration::from_secs(60),
    reconnect_delay: Duration::from_secs(5),
    max_reconnect_attempts: 10,
}
```

**Auto-Reconnection Logic**:
- Background health check every 60 seconds
- Detects when connection count drops below minimum
- Automatically creates new connections to maintain minimum pool size
- Exponential backoff on connection failures
- Tracks reconnection attempts and success/failure rates

**Integration with Circuit Breaker**:
- Connection pool works seamlessly with circuit breaker
- Failed connections are automatically removed from pool
- Circuit breaker protects connection creation operations
- Connection pool health affects overall system health status

### 3. Request Timeout Handling ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `src/timeout_manager.rs`

Comprehensive timeout management system that prevents hanging operations and provides detailed operation monitoring.

**Key Features**:
- Per-operation-type configurable timeouts (Query: 30s, Analysis: 120s, Export: 300s, etc.)
- Concurrent operation limits with overflow protection
- Real-time operation tracking and cancellation
- Comprehensive timeout statistics and metrics
- Background cleanup of orphaned operations

**Configuration**:
```rust
TimeoutConfig {
    default_timeout: Duration::from_secs(60),
    operation_timeouts: {
        Query: Duration::from_secs(30),
        Analysis: Duration::from_secs(120),
        Export: Duration::from_secs(300),
        HealthCheck: Duration::from_secs(10),
        CacheOperation: Duration::from_secs(5),
        FileWatch: Duration::from_secs(60),
    },
    max_concurrent_operations: 1000,
    cleanup_interval: Duration::from_secs(30),
}
```

**Timeout Features**:
- **Operation Tracking**: Every database operation is tracked with unique ID, start time, and timeout duration
- **Automatic Cancellation**: Operations exceeding timeout are automatically cancelled with proper cleanup
- **Concurrency Limits**: Prevents system overload by limiting concurrent operations
- **Statistics Collection**: Tracks completion rates, timeout rates, average durations, and slowest operations
- **Active Operation Monitoring**: Real-time view of currently running operations
- **Background Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of orphaned operations every 30 seconds

**Integration**:
- All `knowledge_graph.rs` operations wrapped with timeout protection
- Health check includes timeout manager statistics
- Per-operation-type timeout customization
- Detailed timeout metrics in health monitoring

### 4. Graceful Cache Degradation ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `src/cache_degradation.rs`

Advanced cache management system that gracefully handles Redis failures by falling back to in-memory caching.

**Key Features**:
- Three-state system: Healthy, Degraded, Recovering
- Automatic Redis -> Memory fallback on Redis failures
- Background health monitoring and automatic recovery
- Fallback statistics and degradation metrics
- Transparent operation - applications continue working during Redis failures

**Configuration**:
```rust
CacheDegradationConfig {
    health_check_interval: Duration::from_secs(30),
    recovery_check_interval: Duration::from_secs(60),
    failure_threshold: 3,
    recovery_threshold: 2,
    memory_cache_max_entries: 10000,
    memory_cache_ttl: Duration::from_secs(300),
    degraded_mode_timeout: Duration::from_secs(1800),
}
```

**Degradation States**:
- **Healthy**: Redis is working normally, all operations use Redis
- **Degraded**: Redis failed, operations fall back to in-memory cache
- **Recovering**: Testing Redis recovery, gradually returning operations to Redis

**Fallback Features**:
- **Automatic Detection**: Monitors Redis health and detects failures
- **Seamless Fallback**: Transparently switches to memory cache when Redis fails
- **Memory Cache**: In-memory LRU cache with configurable size and TTL
- **Recovery Testing**: Periodically tests Redis availability in degraded mode
- **Gradual Recovery**: Slowly transitions back to Redis when it becomes available
- **Statistics Tracking**: Detailed metrics on degraded operations and recovery attempts

**Integration**:
- Replaces standard `CacheManager` in `mcp_server.rs`
- All cache operations automatically handle degradation
- Health check includes cache degradation statistics
- Metrics include fallback usage and recovery status

### 5. Backpressure for File Changes ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `src/backpressure_manager.rs`

Sophisticated backpressure management system that prevents file change processing from overwhelming the system during high activity periods.

**Key Features**:
- Priority-based queuing system (Critical, High, Normal, Low)
- Rate limiting using token bucket algorithm
- Adaptive batching based on system load
- Multiple backpressure modes (Normal, Throttled, Aggressive, Emergency)
- System resource monitoring (CPU, memory)
- Comprehensive statistics and metrics

**Configuration**:
```rust
BackpressureConfig {
    max_queue_size: 10000,
    max_concurrent_operations: 10,
    batch_size: 50,
    batch_timeout_ms: 1000,
    max_files_per_second: 100.0,
    memory_threshold_percent: 80.0,
    cpu_threshold_percent: 85.0,
    adaptive_batching: true,
}
```

**Backpressure Modes**:
- **Normal**: No restrictions, process all file changes normally
- **Throttled**: Rate limit operations, add delays for non-critical files
- **Aggressive**: Drop low priority files, add delays for others
- **Emergency**: Only process critical files, drop everything else

**Priority System**:
- **Critical**: Core config files (Cargo.toml, package.json, Dockerfile)
- **High**: Source code files (.rs, .ts, .js, .py)
- **Normal**: Configuration files (.toml, .yaml, .json)
- **Low**: Documentation and other files (.md, .txt)

**Adaptive Features**:
- **Dynamic Batching**: Adjusts batch size based on CPU/memory load
- **Resource Monitoring**: Tracks system resource usage
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm prevents overwhelming the system
- **Queue Management**: Priority-based queuing with overflow protection
- **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics on processed/dropped files

**Integration**:
