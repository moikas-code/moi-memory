# Knowledge Graph MCP Server Implementation Prompt

## Project Overview

I want you to implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides intelligent persistent memory as a knowledge graph for development projects. This server will automatically capture, store, and make queryable all aspects of a software project including code structure, decisions, documentation, and relationships.

## Key Requirements

**Core Functionality:**
- MCP server that integrates with Claude Code
- Knowledge graph storage using Neo4j for code relationships
- Auto-starting Docker containers for dependencies (Neo4j + Redis)
- Real-time code analysis and relationship tracking
- Natural language querying of project knowledge
- Persistent memory across development sessions

**Performance Goals:**
- <100ms query response time
- Support for 100k+ lines of code
- Real-time updates as code changes
- Efficient caching with Redis

## Technology Stack Decision

Implement in **Rust** for maximum performance, using:
- `bollard` for Docker API integration
- `neo4rs` for Neo4j graph database
- `redis` for caching layer
- `tokio` for async runtime
- `tracing` for logging
- MCP protocol implementation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Error Handling Strategy
- Use `anyhow::Result` for error propagation
- Implement graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Add comprehensive logging with structured context
- Return helpful error messages to Claude Code users

### Performance Considerations
- Implement connection pooling for Neo4j and Redis
- Use batch operations for bulk graph updates
- Cache frequently accessed data in Redis
- Optimize Cypher queries with appropriate indexes
- Use async/await throughout for non-blocking operations

### Security Requirements
- Validate all user inputs and file paths
- Implement rate limiting for expensive operations
- Secure database connections with authentication
- Sanitize code content before storing in graph
- Add audit logging for all graph modifications

## Testing Strategy

Create test fixtures for:
- Sample multi-language codebases
- Known code relationship patterns
- Complex dependency scenarios
- Real-world project structures

Implement benchmarks for:
- Query response times
- Graph update performance
- Memory usage patterns
- Container startup times

## Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:
1. **Single Command Startup**: `cargo run` starts everything automatically
2. **Real-time Updates**: Code changes appear in knowledge graph within 1 second
3. **Fast Queries**: Natural language queries return results in <100ms
4. **Robust Recovery**: Handles container crashes and network issues gracefully
5. **Accurate Analysis**: Correctly identifies code relationships and patterns
6. **Claude Code Integration**: Works seamlessly as an MCP server

## Additional Notes

- Prioritize getting basic functionality working before optimizing
- Use structured logging to debug integration issues
- Test with real codebases early and often
- Focus on developer experience - it should "just work"
- Document any Docker or system requirements clearly

Begin with Phase 1 (Infrastructure Setup) and work through the TODOs systematically. Each phase builds on the previous one, so maintain working functionality as you add features.

The goal is a production-ready MCP server that transforms how developers interact with their codebases by making project knowledge instantly accessible and actionable.
