# Security and Performance Integration

## Overview
Complete integration of security and performance modules into the Knowledge Graph MCP Server has been successfully implemented. All MCP tools now include comprehensive security validation and performance optimization.

## Completed Integration Features

### Security Integration ✅
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT, API key, and session-based authentication
   - Role-based permissions for all tools
   - Unauthenticated access limited to read-only operations

2. **Request Validation**
   - Request size limits and content validation
   - Tool parameter validation
   - Input sanitization for all user inputs

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Session and IP-based rate limiting
   - User tier-based limits (Standard, Premium, Enterprise)
   - Adaptive rate limiting based on system load

4. **Cypher Query Security**
   - Multi-level query sanitization (Standard, Relaxed, Administrative)
   - Injection attack prevention
   - Query complexity analysis

### Performance Integration ✅
1. **Query Optimization**
   - Query plan caching with LRU eviction
   - Parallel query execution for complex queries
   - Result caching with graceful degradation

2. **Memory Management**
   - Real-time memory monitoring
   - Memory pressure detection and throttling
   - Emergency operation denial under high pressure

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Redis primary cache with in-memory fallback
   - Intelligent cache invalidation
   - Cache warming and preloading

## Fully Integrated MCP Tools

### Core Tools
- **query_knowledge**: Cypher sanitization, query caching, parallel execution
- **batch_analyze**: File processing with backpressure management
- **get_metrics**: Comprehensive system statistics
- **health_check**: Multi-component health monitoring

### Analysis Tools
- **export_graph**: Secure data export with format validation
- **analyze_code_structure**: Structure analysis with caching
- **find_relationships**: Relationship discovery with security validation
- **search_similar_code**: Pattern search with query sanitization

### Context Tools
- **get_project_context**: Context retrieval with depth limits
- **track_decision**: Decision tracking with write permissions

## Security Permissions Model

```rust
enum Permission {
    ReadGraph,      // Basic read operations
    WriteGraph,     // Write operations, decision tracking
    AnalyzeCode,    // Code analysis operations
    ExportData,     // Data export operations
    ReadHealth,     // Health and metrics access
    SystemAdministration, // Full access
}
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Collected
- Query execution times with caching hit rates
- Memory usage and pressure levels
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Rate limiting statistics
- Cache performance metrics

### Health Monitoring
- Neo4j connection pool status
- Redis cache health with fallback status
- Memory pressure levels
- Backpressure management statistics
- Security component health

## Configuration

### Security Configuration
```rust
AuthConfig {
    jwt_secret: encrypted,
    session_timeout: 24h,
    api_key_expiry: 90d,
    max_concurrent_sessions: 10
}

RateLimiterConfig {
    requests_per_minute: 60,
    burst_size: 10,
    adaptive_scaling: true
}
```

### Performance Configuration
```rust
QueryCacheConfig {
    max_entries: 1000,
    ttl: 300s,
    lru_eviction: true
}

MemoryMonitorConfig {
    warning_threshold: 80%,
    critical_threshold: 90%,
    emergency_threshold: 95%
}
```
